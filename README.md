## 📌 What is this project?

An automated pipeline that continuously collects compliance evidence from AWS and generates audit-ready reports for **SOC 2 Type II** and **ISO 27001** — reducing audit preparation from months to days.

---

## 🚨 Problem

Manual evidence collection for compliance audits is slow, error-prone, and expensive. Security teams spend weeks gathering screenshots and logs across hundreds of systems before every audit.

## ✅ Solution

Automate evidence collection using AWS-native tools + Python scripts, so evidence is always current and reports are always ready.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| AWS CloudTrail | Audit log of all API activity |
| AWS Config Rules | Continuous compliance checks (MFA, encryption, etc.) |
| Amazon S3 | Immutable evidence storage |
| Python (boto3) | Evidence collection & report generation |
| GitHub | Source control + access log evidence |
